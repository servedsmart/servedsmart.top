Our website is statically hosted using **Cloudflare Workers**, a service provided by:

> **Cloudflare, Inc.**

- Any user profiling or fingerprinting

We do use Cloudflare for:

## Embedded YouTube Videos

We embed videos provided by:

> **Google Ireland Limited**
>
> Gordon House  
> Barrow Street, Dublin 4  
> Ireland

and

> **Google LLC**
> 
> 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  
> Mountain View, California 94043  
> USA

**Google Ireland Limited** is the data controller responsible for processing information for users of Google services based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. **Google LLC** is the data controller responsible for processing information for users of Google services based in the United Kingdom. It is however possible that these data controllers share information with each other.

We embed videos using [youtube-nocookie.com](https://youtube-nocookie.com) to limit the use of tracking technologies before user interaction.

When a video is embedded a connection is established with **YouTube’s servers** to load information about the video. This results in the transfer of personal data, even if you do not interact with the video:

- IP address
- Operating system and version
- Browser type and version
- Date and time of access
- Requested resources

When you **interact** with the video:

- Additional data is transferred to YouTube.
- YouTube may set cookies and use tracking technologies, depending on your browser and privacy settings.
- If you are logged into a Google account, this interaction may be linked to your user profile.

This processing is based on **Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR**. Our legitimate interest is: providing video functionality.

> (NGO operating [openstreetmap.de](https://www.openstreetmap.de))
> 
> Bundesallee 23  
> 10717 Berlin  
> Germany

When loading the map, your browser requests tile images from [tile.openstreetmap.de](https://tile.openstreetmap.de). These requests do not store cookies and the operator does not actively share any personal data with us.

The operator may process the following data for technical and security purposes:

- IP address
- Operating system and version
- Browser type and version
- Date and time of access
- Requested resources

This is done in accordance with **Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR**. Our legitimate interest is: providing map functionality.

## International Data Transfers

We use services that may transfer limited personal data (such as IP addresses or browser metadata) outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including to the United States.

This includes:

- **Cloudflare, Inc.** (USA), for hosting static content.
- **Google LLC** (USA), for embedding YouTube videos.

To safeguard these transfers, we rely on **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** approved by the European Commission under Art. 46 GDPR. Additional technical and organizational safeguards may also apply.
